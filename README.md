# APR_Ass01 â€“ Credit Card Fraud Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project focuses on detecting **fraudulent credit card transactions** using machine learning.  
The dataset is highly **imbalanced** (frauds â‰ˆ 0.17%, non-frauds â‰ˆ 99.83%).  
We explore data preprocessing, resampling techniques, and different classifiers to handle this imbalance.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Understand the dataset distribution.  
- Handle **imbalanced data** using **NearMiss undersampling** and **SMOTE oversampling**.  
- Train and evaluate multiple classifiers:
  - Logistic Regression
- Compare results using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
- Visualize learning curves, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- **Features**: 30 anonymized features (`V1â€¦V28`, `Time`, `Amount`)  
- **Target**:  
  - `0` â†’ Non-fraud  
  - `1` â†’ Fraud  

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Logistic Regression with tuned parameters gave **~94â€“96% accuracy** and ROC-AUC â‰ˆ **0.97**.   
- ROC Curve and Confusion Matrix confirm that **recall is crucial** (better to detect frauds even if some false positives occur).
